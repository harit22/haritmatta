Abstract
Cloud computing promises to significantly change the waywe use computers and access and store our personal and business
information. With these new computing and communicationsparadigms arise new data security challenges. Existing
data protection mechanisms such as encryption have failed inpreventing data theft attacks, especially those perpetrated by
an insider to the cloud provider.We propose a different approach for securing data in the
cloud using offensive decoy technology. We monitor dataaccess in the cloud and detect abnormal data access patterns.
When unauthorized access is suspected and then verified usingchallenge questions, we launch a disinformation attack by
returning large amounts of decoy information to the attacker.This protects against the misuse of the user’s real data.Experiments conducted in a local file setting provide evidence
that this approach may provide unprecedented levels of
